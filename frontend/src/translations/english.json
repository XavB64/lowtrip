The aim of this application is to provide accurate carbon footprints per passenger for each mode of transport and journey. These results enable users to make informed choices in the context of reducing their carbon footprint to curb the effects of global warming.",
      "introduction2": "This application has been developed by a team of four young volunteers. We welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement, which you can send us via the contact page. Thank you in advance for your enthusiasm! :)",
      "inspiringProjects": "Some inspiring projects",
      "mollow1": "Traveling sustainably across Europe, without relying on cars or airplanes, presents numerous challenges. The continent's train and bus networks are diverse and sometimes difficult to navigate, making it tricky to find efficient and affordable connections between countries. This is where ",
      "mollow2": " steps in as a comprehensive web platform designed to revolutionize your travel experience.",
      "mollow3": " Mollow provides a wealth of advice and tested routes to give you inspiration for your next great adventure. The platform is founded on the belief that the journey itself should be a memorable part of your holiday. By embracing this philosophy, Mollow encourages travelers to explore and appreciate the charming cities and breathtaking landscapes that unfold along the way.",
      "sailcoop1": "Accessing islands without relying on planes often involves taking ferries, which can also contribute significantly to carbon emissions per kilometer traveled. To offer a sustainable alternative to traditional ferry travel, Sailcoop presents a unique and eco-friendly solution: sailing with the wind between the mainland and destinations like Corsica.",
      "sailcoop2": "Sailcoop harnesses the power of wind to provide unforgettable journeys across the sea. By opting for sailing trips instead of ferry rides, travelers not only reduce their carbon footprint but also embark on a more immersive and environmentally conscious adventure.",
      "bonpote": "One exemplary project that epitomizes sustainable travel is the journey undertaken by the media Bon Pote to witness the Northern Lights in the Lofoten Islands, traveling entirely by train from Paris. This initiative showcases the feasibility and beauty of overland travel, emphasizing the rewarding experiences that come with reducing reliance on carbon-intensive modes of transportation. They tested our method to estimate their associated carbon footprint.",
      "shimla": "The documentary film 'Shimla', named after the Indian city, explores the theme of water and ecology through an ambitious journey from Paris to India and back using a combination of trains, ferries, and hitchhiking ('autostop'). This innovative approach to travel not only raises awareness about environmental issues but also showcases how diverse modes of transportation can be used to minimize carbon emissions and maximize the richness of the travel experience. Johan and Victoria, the movie makers, trusted lowtrip to estimate the associated carbon footprint of their adventure and subsequent reductions compared to usual means of transportation for such distances."
